            Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide complete beginners to web development.

            The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to
take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start
making your way, learning from the rest of MDN, and other intermediate to
advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.
