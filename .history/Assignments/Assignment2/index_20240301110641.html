                Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide complete beginners to web development.

                The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to
                take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start
                making your way, learning from the <a href="www.example.com">rest of MDN,</a> and other intermediate to
                advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.

                If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we will hold
                your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics
                properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web
                development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class
                materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web technologies work.
